# Notes

### Problem Statement

Develop a notes app, which implements the following use cases: 
- Allow user to create notes from the home screen with a title and content.
- The notes should be saved on the device and displayed as a sorted list in reverse chronological order
- The Home screen should have a search bar which accepts any string and searches the “Title” and “Content” for those strings and displays the matching notes in reverse chronological order
- The search solution should be scalable to thousands of notes
